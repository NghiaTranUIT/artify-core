Christ in the Storm,https://uploads8.wikiart.org/00142/images/rembrandt/christ-in-the-storm.jpg,1930,2400,"The best known work by Rembrandt, this painting resides at the State Museum in Amsterdam, where it is lauded as one of the most famous paintings in the world. For much of its history, the painting was covered with a thick layer of varnish, giving the impression that it was a night scene, hence the name. The varnish was removed in 1940, revealing the bright colors of the painting. The painting has also suffered damage at the hand of art dealers, who in 1715 cut the painting down on three side on order to fit it between two columns, and vandals, who have purposely tried to ruin the painting. In 1975, an unemployed school teacher attacked the work, leaving a large section of zig-zags scratches. The painting was successfully restored, although the scratches are still somewhat visible. In 1990, the painting was attacked again, by a man who threw acid on the canvas. The acid was quickly neutralized, however, and the painting was saved.",1633,Baroque,"Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (Fenway Court), Boston, MA, US",160 x 127 cm,"oil, board, canvas",1,Rembrandt,"15 July 1606; Leiden, Netherlands","04 October 1669; Amsterdam, Netherlands",Dutch,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrand
Flora,https://uploads7.wikiart.org/00180/images/rembrandt/flora.jpg,5000,6160,"Rembrandt painted his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora, goddess of spring and flowers, three times: in 1634,1635 and 1641. In this work he combined elements of pastoral and historical portraits. Created in the year of their marriage, this painting shows the love and admiration the artist felt for the young woman. The contrast between the young sitter's diffident pose and the sumptuousness of her richly embroidered clothes and accessories gives the image a special charm.",1634,Baroque,"Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, Russia",125 x 101 cm,"oil, canvas",1,Rembrandt,"16 July 1606; Leiden, Netherlands","5 October 1669; Amsterdam, Netherlands",Dutch,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrand

The Starry Night,https://uploads3.wikiart.org/00142/images/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night.jpg,5000,3959,"Van Gogh's night sky is a field of roiling energy. Below the exploding stars, the village is a place of quiet order. Connecting earth and sky is the flamelike cypress, a tree traditionally associated with graveyards and mourning. But death was not ominous for van Gogh. ""Looking at the stars always makes me dream,"" he said, ""Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star.""
The artist wrote of his experience to his brother Theo: ""This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning star, which looked very big."" This morning star, or Venus, may be the large white star just left of center in The Starry Night. The hamlet, on the other hand, is invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands. The painting, like its daytime companion, The Olive Trees, is rooted in imagination and memory. Leaving behind the Impressionist doctrine of truth to nature in favor of restless feeling and intense color, as in this highly charged picture, van Gogh made his work a touchstone for all subsequent Expressionist painting.",1889,Post-Impressionism,"Saint-rémy-de-provence, France",92 x 73 cm,"oil, canvas",7,Vincent van Gogh," 30 March 1853; Zundert, Netherlands","29 July 1890; Auvers-sur-Oise, France",Dutch,en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh
